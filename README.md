Purpose:	Simulating a race between a tortoise (Timmy) and a hare (Harold) on a narrow path up the Mount of Doom. 
		Runners take turns moving up the hill, and each runner exhibits randomized behaviour from a predetermined set of moves.
		These moves include climbing quickly or slowly, or slipping back down the hill, or even taking a nap. 

		The program will print the path and when one of the runners reach the top, the program will print the winner.
